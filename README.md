## Data Flow & Processing

### How Data Moves Through the System:

```
PHASE 1: Raw Data → Database
├─ Input: Billboard JSON files (2000-2025) in data/raw/
├─ Process: process_billboard_data.py
│   ├─ Parse JSON files
│   ├─ Extract song, artist, chart position data
│   ├─ Calculate statistics (peak position, weeks on chart, etc.)
│   └─ Insert into: songs, artists, weekly_charts, yearly_charts
└─ Output: 11,645 songs in database (COMPLETE)

PHASE 2: Database → Enriched with Credits
├─ Input: Songs from database (without credits)
├─ Process: enrich_songs_metadata.py --year 2000
│   ├─ Query: SELECT songs WHERE year=2000 AND no credits
│   ├─ For each song:
│   │   ├─ Enhanced search on Genius API
│   │   │   ├─ Clean title (remove censorship, normalize)
│   │   │   ├─ Generate 6 query variations
│   │   │   ├─ Fuzzy match results (85% threshold)
│   │   │   └─ Return best match
│   │   ├─ Extract: writers, producers, featured artists
│   │   ├─ Pre-load existing credits (avoid duplicates)
│   │   └─ INSERT INTO: credits, song_credits, credit_roles
│   ├─ Individual session per song (prevent cascade failures)
│   └─ Commit on success, rollback on failure
└─ Output: 1,248 songs enriched (95% success rate for 2000-2003)

PHASE 3: Database → Classified with Genres & Subgenres
├─ Input: Songs from database (with or without genres)
├─ Process: genre_processing_manager.py --year 2000
│   ├─ Query: SELECT unique artists WHERE year=2000
│   ├─ For each artist:
│   │   ├─ Extract primary artist (remove "feat.", "&", etc.)
│   │   ├─ Call Spotify API → genres + detailed tags (40% weight)
│   │   ├─ Call Last.fm API → community tags (30% weight)
│   │   ├─ Call Chartmetric API → industry genres (20% weight, optional)
│   │   ├─ Query existing Genius genres (10% weight, from Phase 2)
│   │   ├─ Aggregate weighted votes → primary genre
│   │   ├─ Extract subgenres from API detail (neo soul, nu metal, etc.)
│   │   ├─ Filter out genre-level terms (prevents duplicates)
│   │   └─ INSERT INTO: genres, song_genres, subgenres, song_subgenres
│   └─ Handle API failures gracefully (use available sources)
└─ Output: 1,004 songs classified across years 2000-2002 (100% coverage each year)

PHASE 3 ENHANCEMENT: ML Subgenre Classification (INFRASTRUCTURE READY, WAITING ON API)
├─ Current Status: ⏸️ Deferred until Spotify grants audio features API access
├─ What's Ready:
│   ├─ 59 subgenres defined across 9 genres
│   ├─ Training pipeline: train_models.py
│   ├─ Subgenre classifier: ml_subgenre_classifier.py
│   └─ Integration layer: enhanced_genre_classifier.py
└─ What's Blocked:
    ├─ Spotify audio features API (403 Forbidden - need extended quota)
    ├─ Audio features: tempo, energy, danceability, valence, etc. (13 features)
    └─ Training data collection (can't get features without API access)

PHASE 4: Credits → Producer Analytics
├─ Input: Credits from Phase 2
├─ Process: producer_management_analyzer.py
│   ├─ Query: SELECT credits WHERE role='Producer'
│   ├─ Calculate metrics:
│   │   ├─ Success rate (% songs that charted high)
│   │   ├─ #1 hits count
│   │   ├─ Genre diversity
│   │   └─ Peak position averages
│   ├─ INSERT INTO: producer_performance_metrics
│   └─ Optionally verify management (APIs not yet integrated)
└─ Output: Producer analytics and career tracking
```

LIMIT 10;

-- Songs from 2020 that reached top 10
SELECT song_name, artist_name, peak_position
FROM songs
WHERE first_chart_appearance >= '2020-01-01'
AND first_chart_appearance <= '2020-12-31'
AND peak_position <= 10
ORDER BY peak_position;
```

### Genre and Credits Queries (Phase 2)
```sql
-- Pop songs that reached #1
SELECT s.song_name, s.artist_name, s.weeks_at_number_one
FROM songs s
JOIN song_genres sg ON s.song_id = sg.song_id
JOIN genres g ON sg.genre_id = g.genre_id
WHERE g.genre_name = 'Pop' AND s.peak_position = 1;

-- Songs by Max Martin
SELECT s.song_name, s.artist_name, s.peak_position
FROM songs s
JOIN song_credits sc ON s.song_id = sc.song_id

## Recent Improvements (October 2025)

### Phase 2 Fix #1 - Enhanced Search Improvements (October 13, 2025):
**Major breakthrough in Genius API search accuracy:**

1. **Increased result checking** - Checks 15 results instead of 5 (finds songs buried in search results)
2. **Adaptive artist thresholds** - 45% for perfect title matches, 60% for near-perfect, 70% standard
3. **Article removal** - Handles "One" vs "The One" matching
4. **Parenthetical subtitle handling** - Matches "Young'n (Holla Back)" to "Young'n"
5. **Featured artist cleanup** - Removes "feat. Nas" from "Missy Elliott feat. Nas" for better matching
6. **Metadata update on --force** - Updates existing wrong URLs when re-enriching
7. **Strong artist validation** - Requires 85% artist match for parenthetical matching (prevents false positives)
8. **Dependency fix** - Installed fuzzywuzzy for proper fuzzy matching

**Result**: 
- Year 2000: 98.5% → **100% coverage** (413/413 songs, +6 recovered)
- Year 2001: 96.2% → **98.3% coverage** (282/289 songs, +4 recovered)
- All 12 wrong Genius URLs corrected
- 0 false positives, 94% search accuracy validated
- Total: 12 songs recovered across 2 years

### Phase 2 Previous Bug Fixes (October 10, 2025):
1. **Critical: IntegrityError handling** - Changed from batch sessions to individual sessions per song
2. **Critical: Enhanced search not used** - Fixed `get_song_metadata` to use found song_id
3. **Duplicate credit prevention** - Pre-load existing credits into set for O(1) lookup
4. **Censorship handling** - Clean titles: `b***h` → `bitch`, `a**` → `ass`, etc.
5. **Punctuation handling** - New query strategy removes punctuation: `cam'ron` → `camron`

**Result**: Initial coverage 85% → 95%

### Database Cleanup (October 13, 2025):
- Deleted redundant chart_positions table (100% duplicate of weekly_charts)
- Deleted 2 empty Phase 4 tables (producer_management, management_effectiveness)
- Previous cleanup: 4 unused Spotify tables, 10 duplicate genres
- Database optimized: 52 MB → 33 MB (19 MB saved via VACUUM)
- Streamlined documentation (27 → 5 README files)
- Removed 6 audio features-only scripts (blocked by Spotify API)

### Phase 3 Enhancements:
- Fixed year hardcoding - now supports ANY year via --year argument
- Fixed SQLAlchemy func import bug
- Successfully tested with year 2001 (7 songs classified)
- Multi-source classification working (Spotify genres + Last.fm + Genius)

### Phase 3 Subgenre System (NEW - October 10, 2025):
1. **API-Based Subgenres** - Extracts detailed genres from APIs (neo soul, nu metal, etc.)
   - 166 subgenres stored across 11 parent genres
   - 48.1% subgenre coverage (483 songs with subgenres)
   - 852 total subgenre assignments (avg 1.8 per song)
   - Filters out genre-level terms (soul, funk, rap) → only compound terms saved

2. **Producer-Based Enrichment** - Uses Phase 2 credits to add subgenres
   - Analyzes 180 producers with 2+ songs in database
   - Maps producer specializations (Max Martin → dance-pop, teen-pop)
   - High confidence (0.85-0.95) based on producer signatures
   - 13 songs enriched with 35 producer-based subgenre assignments
   - Script: `enrich_producer_subgenres.py`

3. **Subgenre Duplicate Fix** - Resolved semantic duplicates
   - Removed 35 genre-level terms incorrectly stored as subgenres
   - Cleaned 189 incorrect song-subgenre links
   - Added validation to prevent future duplicates
   - Utility: `cleanup_duplicate_subgenres.py`
   - Documentation: `SUBGENRE_DUPLICATE_FIX.md`

4. **Incomplete Classification Fix** (NEW) - Ensures 100% coverage
   - Fixed skip logic to check ALL songs by artist, not just one
   - Automatically completes partial classifications on re-runs
   - Eliminated need for manual SQL fixes after processing
   - Tested successfully: Year 2001 improved from 93.8% → 100%

**Result**: Clean subgenre system with 166 valid subgenres, guaranteed 100% coverage, no semantic duplicates

### ML Infrastructure (Deferred):
- Defined 59 subgenres across 9 genres
- Training pipeline ready (train_models.py, subgenre_definitions.py)
- Deleted 6 blocked scripts (audio features API returns 403)
- Will activate when Spotify approves extended quota

## Current Limitations & Blockers

### ⚠️ Spotify API Access:
- **Blocked**: Audio features API (403 Forbidden)
- **Working**: Search, track metadata
- **Need**: Extended quota approval from Spotify
- **Impact**: Cannot train ML subgenre models with real data yet
- **Workaround**: Pop model trained with mock data (proven pipeline works)
- **Solution**: Request extended quota (1-3 day approval)

### 📅 Coverage Gaps:
- **Years 2000-2003**: ✅ 95% enriched (1,248 songs)
- **Years 2004-2025**: ⏸️ Not yet enriched (~9,000+ songs remaining)
- **Plan**: Enrich years incrementally (2004 → 2010 → 2025)

### 🎯 ML Models (Deferred):
- **Status**: Infrastructure ready, waiting on Spotify audio features API
- **Subgenres defined**: 59 subgenres across 9 genres
- **Training pipeline**: Ready to use when API access granted
- **Blockers**: Spotify audio features API (403 Forbidden)
- **Deleted**: 6 audio-only scripts that can't work without API access

## Current Status & Roadmap

  - Overall 2000-2003: ~97% coverage
  - Total: 1,500+ songs enriched, 3,500+ credits
  - Search accuracy: 94% validated, 2% false positive rate
- **Phase 3**: Multi-source genre classification (1,004 songs, years 2000-2002, 100% each year)
- **Phase 3 Subgenres**: API-based subgenre system (166 subgenres, 183 songs in 2000, 124 in 2001)
- **Phase 4**: Producer management infrastructure ready (841 producers, 689 with genre tags)
- **Database Cleanup**: All wrong URLs corrected, redundant tables removed (23 → 19), optimized to 33 MB
- **Bug Fixes**: Phase 2 Fix #1 (8 improvements) + previous 6 critical bugs + 4 Phase 3 bugs
- **Dependencies**: fuzzywuzzy installed for accurate fuzzy matching
- **Documentation**: 5 essential README files (comprehensive project documentation)

### 🔄 In Progress
- **Phase 2**: Ready to expand to years 2004-2025 (script supports --year for any year)
- **Phase 3**: Ready to classify years 2003-2025 (1,004 songs classified so far, script production-ready)
- **ML Subgenres**: Deferred until Spotify audio features API access granted

### 📋 Next Steps
1. Continue Phase 3 classification (years 2003-2025, ~10,000 songs remaining)
2. Run producer enrichment on classified years
3. Continue Phase 2 enrichment (2004-2010) as needed
4. Request Spotify Extended Quota (for ML training with audio features)
5. Train ML subgenre models once Spotify approves

### 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Real-time chart updates automation
- Web interface and visualization dashboard
- API endpoint for external access
- Additional music APIs (MusicBrainz, Discogs)

## Quick Commands Reference

### Check Current Status:
```bash
# Database stats
python3 << 'EOF'
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('data/music_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM songs")
print(f"Songs: {cursor.fetchone()[0]:,}")
cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT song_id) FROM song_credits")
print(f"With credits: {cursor.fetchone()[0]:,}")
cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT song_id) FROM song_genres")
print(f"With genres: {cursor.fetchone()[0]:,}")
conn.close()
EOF
```

### Phase 2 - Enrich Year:
```bash
cd phase2
# Full year
python scripts/enrich_songs_metadata.py --year 2004

# Test with limit
python scripts/enrich_songs_metadata.py --year 2004 --limit 50

# Check results
python scripts/dashboard_analytics.py
```

### Phase 3 - Classify Year:
```bash
cd phase3/scripts
# Classify genres
python genre_classification_system.py --year 2004

# View results
python ar_insights_analyzer.py --year 2004
```

### Phase 3 - ML Training (When Spotify API Approved):
```bash
cd phase3

# Once Spotify grants audio features API access:
# Train model with collected features
python training/train_models.py --genre pop

# Test enhanced classification
python src/enhanced_genre_classifier.py
```

### Common Queries:
```sql
-- Songs enriched per year
SELECT 
  strftime('%Y', first_chart_appearance) as year,
  COUNT(DISTINCT s.song_id) as total_songs,
  COUNT(DISTINCT sc.song_id) as with_credits,
  ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT sc.song_id) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT s.song_id), 1) as coverage_pct
FROM songs s
LEFT JOIN song_credits sc ON s.song_id = sc.song_id
WHERE year >= '2000'
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year;

-- Top producers by song count
SELECT c.credit_name, COUNT(*) as song_count
FROM credits c
JOIN song_credits sc ON c.credit_id = sc.credit_id
JOIN credit_roles cr ON sc.role_id = cr.role_id
WHERE cr.role_name = 'Producer'
GROUP BY c.credit_name
ORDER BY song_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Genre distribution
SELECT g.genre_name, COUNT(*) as song_count
FROM genres g
JOIN song_genres sg ON g.genre_id = sg.genre_id
GROUP BY g.genre_name
ORDER BY song_count DESC;
```

## Documentation Policy (Important for AI Assistants)

### ⚠️ README-Only Approach:

This project uses an **ever-updating README approach** to minimize documentation sprawl. After extensive documentation cleanup (27 → 8 files), we've established these rules:

**✅ DO:**
- Update this README.md with new progress, features, and current state
- Update phase-specific READMEs (phase1, phase2, phase3, phase4) for implementation details
- Show analysis results, test outputs, and intermediate findings directly in chat
- Keep this README as the single source of truth for project status

**❌ DO NOT:**
- Create new markdown files for analysis, comparisons, or planning
- Create status documents or summary files
- Create temporary documentation files
- Create duplicate documentation

**📋 When Updates Are Needed:**
- **Progress updates**: Update "Current Status & Roadmap" section
- **New features**: Update relevant phase overview and features section
- **Bug fixes**: Update "Recent Improvements" section
- **Data changes**: Update "Database Statistics" section
- **New blockers**: Update "Current Limitations & Blockers" section

**Why This Approach:**
- Single, comprehensive document vs. scattered information
- Easy for AI assistants to find current project state
- Reduces maintenance overhead
- Prevents documentation drift and duplication
- Clear project history timeline in git commits to README

**History**: Documentation reduced from 27 files (October 8, 2025) to 9 essential files (October 10, 2025) through systematic cleanup and consolidation.
