# Phase 4: Producer Management Tracking

This phase focuses on analyzing producer management status and generating A&R insights for the Billboard Music Database.

## Overview

Phase 4 builds upon the completed Phase 2 (credits enrichment) and Phase 3 (genre classification) by adding comprehensive producer management tracking and A&R analytics.

## Features

- **Management Company Tracking**: Identifies which producers are under management
- **Verification System**: Multi-source verification of management status
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks producer success rates and hit counts
- **A&R Insights**: Generates actionable insights for music industry professionals
- **Management Effectiveness**: Analyzes which management companies are most effective

## Database Schema

### Tables (Phase 4)

**Active Tables (3):**
- `management_companies`: Master catalog of management companies, labels, and publishers (27 companies)
- `management_verification`: Records verification attempts and results (3 records)
- `producer_performance_metrics`: Tracks producer success metrics by year (3 producers)

**Note**: Empty infrastructure tables (`producer_management`, `management_effectiveness`) were removed during October 13, 2025 database optimization. They can be recreated when Phase 4 is fully activated.

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup Phase 4 Tables

```bash
cd phase4
python scripts/producer_management_analyzer.py --setup-only
```

### 2. Test with Small Dataset

```bash
python scripts/producer_management_analyzer.py --test --limit 5
```

### 3. Run Full Analysis

```bash
python scripts/producer_management_analyzer.py --limit 50
```

## Key Features

### Management Verification

The system verifies producer management status through multiple sources:

1. **Web Search**: Searches for management company mentions
2. **Social Media**: Checks producer social media profiles
3. **Industry Databases**: Queries music industry databases
4. **Manual Verification**: Allows manual verification and notes

### Performance Metrics

Tracks comprehensive producer performance:

- **Hit Success Rate**: Percentage of songs that chart
- **Number One Hits**: Count of #1 hits
- **Top 10/40 Hits**: Count of top 10 and top 40 hits
- **Genre Diversity**: How many different genres they work in
- **Collaboration Count**: Number of different artists they work with

### A&R Insights

Generates actionable insights for A&R professionals:

- **Top Performing Producers**: Ranked by success rate
- **Management Company Effectiveness**: Which companies produce the most hits
- **Unmanaged High Performers**: Successful producers without management
- **Market Trends**: Producer performance trends over time

## Scripts

### `producer_management_analyzer.py`
Main analysis script that:
- Sets up Phase 4 database tables
- Analyzes producer management status
- Calculates performance metrics
- Generates A&R insights

**Usage:**
```bash
# Test mode (3 producers)
python scripts/producer_management_analyzer.py --test

# Analyze specific number of producers
python scripts/producer_management_analyzer.py --limit 25

# Setup only
python scripts/producer_management_analyzer.py --setup-only

# Verbose output
python scripts/producer_management_analyzer.py --test --verbose
```

## Database Views

### `producers_with_management`
Shows all producers with their management information:
```sql
SELECT * FROM producers_with_management 
WHERE is_current = 1 
ORDER BY company_name, credit_name;
```

**Note**: Views for `producer_management` and `management_effectiveness` tables exist but underlying tables were removed during October 2025 optimization. Tables can be recreated when Phase 4 is fully activated.

### `management_effectiveness_summary`
Shows management company effectiveness (view exists, underlying table removed):
```sql
SELECT * FROM management_effectiveness_summary 
ORDER BY total_number_ones DESC;
```

### `top_producers_by_management`
Shows top producers grouped by management company (view exists, underlying table removed):
```sql
SELECT * FROM top_producers_by_management 
WHERE is_current = 1 
ORDER BY success_rate DESC;
```

## Example Queries

### Find Unmanaged High Performers
```sql
-- Note: producer_management table removed during Oct 2025 optimization
-- This query would work once table is recreated for Phase 4
/*
SELECT 
    c.credit_name,
    ppm.success_rate,
    ppm.number_one_hits,
    ppm.total_songs
FROM credits c
JOIN producer_performance_metrics ppm ON c.credit_id = ppm.producer_id
LEFT JOIN producer_management pm ON c.credit_id = pm.producer_id AND pm.is_current = 1
WHERE pm.producer_id IS NULL
AND ppm.success_rate > 50
ORDER BY ppm.success_rate DESC;
*/
```

### Management Company Performance
```sql
-- Note: producer_management table removed during Oct 2025 optimization  
-- This query would work once table is recreated for Phase 4
/*
SELECT 
    mc.company_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT pm.producer_id) as total_producers,
    AVG(ppm.success_rate) as avg_success_rate,
    SUM(ppm.number_one_hits) as total_number_ones
FROM management_companies mc
JOIN producer_management pm ON mc.company_id = pm.company_id
JOIN producer_performance_metrics ppm ON pm.producer_id = ppm.producer_id
WHERE pm.is_current = 1
GROUP BY mc.company_id, mc.company_name
ORDER BY avg_success_rate DESC;
*/
```
